Visual content found within the book is available here in high quality.

SOME of the High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Aerial Photography in the folder "**locations**" is premium content from Maxar Technologies, Landsat, Himawari-8 etc and reuse is allowed but must be attributed to both the content provider (in the filename) and this repo. Landsat imagery is provided by NASA and is in public domain for research and educational purposes.



Please note some of the satellite imagery acquired in the book is from High Resolution captures which have been saved as JPEG for this repo due to size constraints.



*Please note: some images may be missing due to various issues such as copyright licensing :(*
